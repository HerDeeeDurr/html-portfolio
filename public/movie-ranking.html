<h1>Top 3 Recommended Movies From Julian</h1>

<h2> My 3 suggested movies </h2>

<hr />

<h3> Dune </h3>
<p> Really dope sci-fi movie with outstanding performances and cast, combined with some intriguing science.</p>

<h3> Talk To Me</h3>
<p> Returns the horror in horror movies; something that contemporary horror movies seem to lack or struggle with.</p>

<h3> Idiocracy</h3>
<p> A mindless watch, but also an essay on the future of humanity in an amusing, yet probable way.</p>
