<h1 alignment>About Me</h1>
<p>Aspiring full stack developer, still in the making. I'm very ambitious to learn and excited to apply creativite solutions to any website designs
  or application programming. This summary conveys my iniation into the coding world, and hopefully will prove to be capable once any updates
  are made to this section. 
</p>

<p>I currently have extensive experience in the Time & Attendance industry, which is often married with the access control industry - sometimes viewed as a single industry.
  Additionally, I have some basic networking knowledge which I've accumulated throughout my journey in this industry, and am now ready to advance to a 
  broader and more technical scope of technology.
